I am planning to implement a RISC-V SoC, I will devide this into following three phases.

#### instruction per cycle

First, I will implement a simple RISC-V cpu Which only finish one instruction per cycle.

#### pipe line

Second, I will implement a pipe-lined RISC-V CPU with 3 and 5 stages.

#### super scalar

Lastly, I will implement a super scalar RISC-V CPU.
